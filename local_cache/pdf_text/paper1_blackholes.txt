It has recently been pointed out that one can construct invertible conformal transformations
with a parity-violating conformal factor, which can be employed to generate a novel class of parity-
violating ghost-free metric theories from general relativity. We obtain exact solutions for rotating
black holes in such theories by performing the conformal transformation on the Kerr solution in
general relativity, which we dub conformal Kerr solutions. We explore the geodesic motion of a test
particle in the conformal Kerr spacetime. While null geodesics remain the same as those in the Kerr
spacetime, timelike geodesics exhibit interesting differences due to an effective external force caused
by the parity-violating conformal factor.
I. INTRODUCTION
Symmetries play essential roles in physics. For instance, the Lorentz symmetry is one of the fundamental symmetries
in particle physics and general relativity (GR). In the Standard Model of particle physics, invariance under charge
conjugation, parity transformation, and time reversal (CPT symmetry) is another fundamental symmetry. While the
Standard Model respects the CPT symmetry, each individual symmetry may be broken. In fact, in 1950s, it was
found that the parity conservation is broken in the weak sector [1, 2], which is the only parity violation observed in
nature so far. The violation of the CP symmetry in the weak sector was also detected [3, 4]. The parity violation
may also occur in a new particle sector beyond the Standard Model or gravity sector, which may be detected via
cosmological and astrophysical probes. The possibility to detect the parity violation in electromagnetism and/or
gravity sector on the cosmic microwave background has been attracting much attention for a long time [5–20]. More
recently, advances in observations of gravitational waves have also enabled us to detect the possible parity violation
in our Universe [21–35].
From a theoretical point of view, we can consider parity-violating theories of gravity, for instance by incorporating
the Chern-Simons term (or Pontryagin density) in the action, which is known as Chern-Simons gravity [36, 37] (see
also Ref. [38] for a review). In such a parity-violating theory of gravity, spherically symmetric solutions are not
modified from those in GR, since the Pontryagin density trivially vanishes under the spherical symmetry. Therefore,
in order to observe the parity-violation in a spherically symmetric black hole (BH) background, one needs to consider
perturbations about it [39–48]. To the best of our knowledge, all the parity-violating gravitational theories studied so
far, including Chern-Simons gravity, yield ghost degrees of freedom in general, which was confirmed for perturbations
on a static and spherically symmetric background [44, 45]. Hence, they should be regarded as an effective field theory
which is valid at most up to an energy scale below the mass of the ghosts.
Another possibility to detect the parity violation in the gravity sector is to consider an axisymmetric spacetime or
rotating BH, where the effects of parity violation can show up even at the background level. In particular, the faster
the BH rotates, the more significant the impact of the parity violation is expected to be. Rotating BHs in Chern-
Simons gravity have been studied perturbatively in the slow-rotation [49–55] and near-extremal [56] approximations,
as well as numerically [57–59] (see also Refs. [60, 61]). In dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, configurations of a
scalar field around rotating BHs developed via spontaneous scalarization and superradiant instabilities have been
investigated in Refs. [62–66] and Ref. [67], respectively. Also, observational signatures of Chern-Simons gravity have
been investigated in Refs. [37, 68–72]. On the other hand, it was argued in Ref. [73] that physical rotating BHs
can exist in nondynamical Chern-Simons gravity only if the metric breaks the stationarity, axisymmetry, or energy-
momentum conservation. Slowly rotating BHs in other parity-violating theories with higher-curvature corrections
and observational signatures from them have also been studied [74–80]. An effective field theory for perturbations
of axisymmetric and slowly rotating solutions was discussed including the parity-violating terms in Ref. [81]. A
phenomenological parametrization for parity-violating Kerr-like metrics has been studied in Refs. [82, 83] within a
family of metrics where the geodesic equations are separable [84]. However, despite such extensive studies of BHs in
parity-violating theories, no exact solution of rotating BHs has been reported so far.
A possible way to generate such nontrivial solutions is to perform an invertible conformal/disformal transformationarXiv:2312.11899v2  [gr-qc]  20 May 2024

on known solutions in GR or any other modified gravity models. For instance, the disformal transformation of static
and spherically symmetric solutions with a stealth scalar profile has been studied in Refs. [85, 86]. Other known
examples are a disformal Kerr solution [87, 88] and a conformal Kerr solution [89],*1which are generated from the
stealth Kerr solution in scalar-tensor theories. The point is that the invertibility of the transformation guarantees
the existence of a gravitational theory that can accommodate the generated metric as an exact solution. We also
note that an invertible transformation maps a gravitational theory to another theory without changing the number of
propagating degrees of freedom [90, 91]. In particular, if the seed theory is GR, then the generated theory possesses two
tensorial degrees of freedom and is free from the problem of Ostrogradsky ghosts [92–95] just as in GR. Recently, the
authors of Ref. [96] found a new class of invertible conformal transformations involving a parity-violating interaction.
By performing this novel invertible transformation on the Kerr solution in GR, one can obtain a rotating BH metric as
an exact solution in a parity-violating ghost-free theory. The aim of the present paper is to demonstrate the strategy
above and investigate the properties of the solution, including the geodesic motion of a test particle.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In §II, we review the invertible conformal transformation involving a
parity-violating interaction proposed in Ref. [96] and use it to construct a rotating BH solution in a parity-violating
gravitational theory. In §III, we study the geodesic motion of a test particle to clarify how it is different from the one
in GR. Finally, we draw our conclusions in §IV.
II. BLACK HOLES IN PARITY-VIOLATING GRAVITY FROM CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATION
A. Transformation law
Let us briefly review the invertible conformal transformation involving curvature invariants introduced in Ref. [96].
We consider the conformal transformation
¯gµν[g] = Ω( C,P)gµν, (1)
where Ω is a positive definite function of CandP, with Cbeing a contraction of the Weyl tensor WµνλσandPbeing
the Chern-Simons (or Pontryagin) term defined by [36, 73]
C:=WαβγδWαβγδ =RαβγδRαβγδ−2RαβRαβ+1
3R2,
P:=1
2εαβγδRµν
αβRµνγδ=1
2εαβγδWµν
αβWµνγδ.(2)
The totally antisymmetric tensor εαβγδin the definition of Pmanifests its parity-violating nature. It should be
noted that CandPare the only scalar quantities that are “conformally covariant” (i.e., invariant under a conformal
transformation up to some powers of the conformal factor) up to the quadratic order in the curvature tensor. Indeed,
they are covariant with weight −2 under any conformal transformation:
¯C= Ω−2C, ¯P= Ω−2P. (3)
Note that Ω here can be identified with the one in (1). In this case, Eq. (3) defines a map ( C,P)7→(¯C,¯P), which can
be solved for CandPat least locally if the Jacobian determinant is nonvanishing, i.e.,
∂(¯C,¯P)
∂(C,P)∝1−2C
Ω∂Ω
∂C−2P
Ω∂Ω
∂P̸= 0. (4)
Once we obtain CandPas functions of ¯Cand ¯P, the inverse transformation of (1) can be given by
gµν[¯g] =¯Ω(¯C,¯P)¯gµν, ¯Ω(¯C,¯P):= Ω(C,P)−1. (5)
More generally, one could include any other conformally covariant scalar quantities (e.g., WαβγδWγδµνWµναβ) in
the conformal factor to generalize the transformation law (1). When the conformal factor is a function of conformally
covariant quantities CI(I= 1,2,···) such that ¯CI= ΩwICI, the invertibility condition is given by
∂¯CI
∂CJ∝1 +X
IwICI
Ω∂Ω
∂CI̸= 0. (6)
*1In§II B, we shall also refer to our BH solution as the conformal Kerr solution, though it is qualitatively different from that in Ref. [89]:
Their solution does not correspond to a stationary metric, where an explicit time dependence is introduced by the conformal transfor-
mation.

By use of such invertible transformations, one can generate a class of ghost-free higher-derivative metric theories
from GR since an invertible transformation does not change the number of physical degrees of freedom [90, 91]. In
other words, after performing the invertible conformal transformation (1) or its generalization mentioned above, the
higher-order derivatives of the metric automatically satisfy the degeneracy condition [97, 98].*2Starting from the
Einstein-Hilbert action

with MPlbeing the reduced Planck mass. Here, we have omitted boundary terms, and ¯ gµνis now regarded as the
physical metric. Note that the action (8) involves the parity-violating Chern-Simons term through ¯Ω. It should also
be noted that the action is written only by the metric, unlike the case of Chern-Simons gravity where a scalar field
(which can be either dynamical or nondynamical) is present.
As a concrete example, let us consider the case where the conformal factor has the form*3

which involves infinitely many higher-derivative interactions. Therefore, truncated at some finite power of α, the
theory described by the action (13) would yield Ostrogradsky ghosts. Nevertheless, due to the invertibility of the
*2Noninvertible transformations could also be used to generate theories with degenerate higher-derivative terms [99–101]. Having said
that, we do not consider this possibility in the present paper.
*3Another possible choice of the conformal factor would be Ω = exp( αP/Λ4), but in this case the invertibility condition (4) is violated at
P= Λ4/2α.

conformal transformation, the action (13) as a whole should describe a ghost-free theory. (See Ref. [102] for a similar
example.)
However, when matter fields are taken into account, the problem of Ostrogradsky ghosts shows up in general.
This is because the matter action does not respect the degeneracy condition that the gravitational action (8) or (13)
satisfies. (See also Refs. [96, 103–109] for discussions on a similar problem in the context of scalar-tensor theories.)
Since the ghosts appear only in the presence of matter fields, their mass should scale as some inverse power of the
matter energy density. Therefore, from the EFT viewpoint, the ghosts would be irrelevant at low energies when the
energy density of the matter fields is sufficiently small. In the present paper, we mainly consider a vacuum solution
in the theory described by the action (13) and the motion of a test particle around it, and hence the ghosts may be
safely neglected.*4
B. Application to the Kerr metric
Since the action (8) is obtained from the Einstein-Hilbert action via the invertible conformal transformation (1),
any (vacuum) solution in GR is mapped to a solution in the theory described by (8). More concretely, for a given
solution gµν=g(0)
µνin GR, we obtain an exact solution in the transformed theory as
¯gµν= Ω(C(0),P(0))g(0)
µν, (15)
where C(0)andP(0)denote the quantities CandPassociated with g(0)
µν, respectively.
In what follows, let us focus on the Kerr metric (i.e., the unique vacuum solution in GR that is stationary, axially
symmetric, and asymptotically flat) as the seed of the transformation, and we shall refer to the transformed metric
as the conformal Kerr metric. In terms of the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates [110, 111], the Kerr metric takes the form
gµνdxµdxν=−∆
ρ2(dt−asin2θdφ)2+ρ2
∆dr2+ρ2dθ2+sin2θ
ρ2
adt−(r2+a2)dφ2, (16)
where we have defined
ρ2=r2+a2cos2θ, ∆ =r2+a2−2Mr, (17)
with abeing the angular momentum per unit mass and M(>0) being a parameter of length dimension corresponding
to the BH mass. Note that ∆( r) has two different real roots r±:=M±√
M2−a2for 0 <|a|< M, where r+andr−
correspond to the radii of outer and inner horizons, respectively. For the Kerr metric, the quantities CandPcan be
evaluated as
C=48M2(r6−15a2r4cos2θ+ 15a4r2cos4θ−a6cos6θ)
ρ12,
P=−96aM2rcosθ(r2−3a2cos2θ)(3r2−a2cos2θ)
ρ12.(18)
It should be noted that Ccoincides with the Kretschmann scalar because of the Ricci flatness of the Kerr metric, and
the Chern-Simons term Pis proportional to aand therefore vanishes in the non-rotating limit. In Fig. 1, we show
contour plots of the Chern-Simons term Pfor different values of a. For reference, we also show the points where |P|
takes its maximum on the horizon (see also Appendix A).
Let us now consider the conformal transformation with the conformal factor of the form (9). In this case, the
conformal Kerr metric
¯gµν=

gµν (gµν: Kerr metric) (19)
*4However, even in vacuum, quantum effects of matter fields should be take into account in practice. This could also spoil the degeneracy
condition, and we should make sure that the cutoff of the EFT is well above the energy scale of our interest. Moreover, the correction
terms in the effective action could modify a classical solution. Therefore, for the classical solution to remain valid, the correction terms
should have small magnitudes when evaluated for the classical solution. These requirements would put a bound on the parameter α,
and a detailed analysis on this issue is beyond the scope of the present paper.

which is nonvanishing unless a= 0. This shows that the conformal Kerr metric is not connected to the Kerr metric via
a coordinate transformation. Nevertheless, the conformal Kerr metric remains asymptotically flat.*5Also, similarly
to the Kerr metric, the curvature singularity shows up at ρ= 0 only. We will present expressions of other curvature
invariants in Appendix B.
There are several remarks on the properties of the conformal Kerr solutions obtained in this subsection. First, the
value of rat the outer and inner horizons does not change from that of the original Kerr metric, as the solution is
conformally equivalent to the Kerr metric. Second, the circularity of the spacetime, i.e., the invariance of the metric
under ( t, φ)→(−t,−φ), is maintained.*6Finally, the Petrov type of the solution remains unchanged (i.e., remains
to be type D) since the Weyl tensor Wµνλσis invariant under a conformal transformation.
III. GEODESICS
In this section, we investigate the geodesic motion of a test particle on the conformal Kerr background. The
trajectory of the particle is denoted by xµ=xµ(s), where sis an affine parameter and can be identified as the proper
time in the case of a timelike particle. The geodesic equation can be written as
¨xλ+¯Γλ
µν˙xµ˙xν= 0, (21)
*5In what follows, even when we consider a more general conformal transformation, we always assume that the conformal factor approaches
unity for large rso that the metric remains asymptotically flat.
*6On the other hand, the disformal Kerr solution [87, 88] does not respect the circularity, which could lead to nontrivial observable
effects [112].

where we have defined
−κ:= ¯gαβ˙xα˙xβ= ¯gtt˙t2+ 2¯gtφ˙t˙φ+ ¯gφφ˙φ2+ ¯grr˙r2+ ¯gθθ˙θ2, (24)
and the affine parameter is chosen so that κ= 1 and 0 for the timelike and null geodesics, respectively. Interestingly,
in terms of a new affine parameter ˜ ssuch that d˜ s= Ω−1ds, we have
d2xλ
d˜s2+ Γλ
µνdxµ
d˜sdxν
d˜s=Fλ, (25)
which is nothing but the geodesic equation for the Kerr background with an effective external force Fλ. Note that
the nonvanishing components of Fλare only FrandFθsince Ω = Ω( r, θ) in our setup. Also, Fλvanishes identically
for a null geodesic that has κ= 0.
Note that the geodesic equation (21) can be equivalently written as
(¯gλµ˙xµ)·−1
2˙xµ˙xν∂λ¯gµν= 0. (26)
Together with the fact that the components of the conformal Kerr metric do not depend explicitly on torφ, we find
that there exist two conserved quantities:
−E:= ¯gtµ˙xµ= ¯gtt˙t+ ¯gtφ˙φ,
Lz:= ¯gφµ˙xµ= ¯gtφ˙t+ ¯gφφ˙φ,(27)
where EandLzcorrespond to the energy and the angular momentum of the particle (per unit mass), respectively.
In what follows, we study the geodesic motion of null or timelike particles in the conformal Kerr spacetime.
Throughout this section, we assume a >0 for simplicity.
A. Null geodesics
Let us now consider the case of null geodesics, for which κ= 0. In this case, the right-hand side of Eq. (25) vanishes,
and hence the geodesic equation has exactly the same form as the one for the Kerr background, reflecting the fact
that a null geodesic remains unchanged under a conformal transformation. As a result, the geodesic equation for a
massless particle on the conformal Kerr background is completely integrable, just as in the Kerr case. Indeed, when
κ= 0, there exists a conserved quantity defined by
Q:= ¯g2
θθ˙θ2+ cos2θL2
z
sin2θ−a2E2
, (28)
which corresponds to the Carter constant for a massless particle on the Kerr background [113]. Therefore, we obtain
the following system of equations:
Ωρ2˙t=aW+(r2+a2)V
∆r, Ωρ2˙φ=W
sin2θ+aV
∆r, Ω2ρ4˙r2=V2−∆rK, Ω2ρ4˙θ2=K −W2
sin2θ, (29)
where we have defined
V:= (r2+a2)E−aLz,W:=Lz−aEsin2θ, K:=Q+ (Lz−aE)2. (30)
Since the null geodesic on the conformal Kerr background is the same as the one for the Kerr background, one cannot
tell the difference between the two from the motion of a massless test particle.

--- page 7 ---

7
Note that the conserved quantity Qfor a null geodesic is related to a conformal Killing tensor [114]. Let Kµνbe
the nontrivial Killing tensor [114] (such that ∇(µKαβ)= 0) for the seed Kerr metric, i.e.,
Kµνdxµdxν=r2gµνdxµdxν+ ∆(d t−asin2θdφ)2−ρ4
∆dr2. (31)
Then, one can show that ˜Kµν:= Ω2Kµνis a conformal Killing tensor on the conformal Kerr background. Indeed, we
have
¯∇(µ˜Kαβ)= ¯g(αβKν
µ)∂νΩ. (32)
One can show that the quantity Qdefined in Eq. (28) coincides with ˜Kµν˙xµ˙xνfor a null geodesic.
B. Timelike circular orbits
In this subsection, we study timelike circular orbits [corresponding to κ= 1 in Eq. (23)] that are normal to the
symmetry axis, for which r(s) = const and θ(s) = const. As we discuss in Appendix C, it is useful to define an
effective potential by
Veff(r, θ):= 1 +L2
z¯gtt+ 2ELz¯gtφ+E2¯gφφ
¯gtt¯gφφ−¯g2
tφ. (33)
In terms of this Veff, a circular orbit can be realized at ( r, θ) such that Veffand its first derivatives vanish. From
Veff= 0 and Eq. (27), we get
E=−¯gtt+ ¯gtφωp
−(¯gtt+ 2¯gtφω+ ¯gφφω2), L z=¯gtφ+ ¯gφφωp
−(¯gtt+ 2¯gtφω+ ¯gφφω2). (34)
Here, we have defined the orbital angular velocity ω:= ˙φ/˙t, which is constant for a circular orbit. With the rela-
tions (34), the functional form of the effective potential Veff(r, θ) is determined by ωonly. Then, ∂rVeff= 0 and
∂θVeff= 0 yield two conditions on r,θ, and ω, which can be used to express, e.g., θandωas functions of r. This
means that the expression inside the square root in Eq. (34) can be regarded as a function of r, and it has to be
positive so that EandLzare real. Actually, there exists a critical radius at which ¯ gtt+ 2¯gtφω+ ¯gφφω2= 0. As r
approaches this critical radius, the energy Eof the particle diverges, and hence the trajectory of the particle would
approach a null geodesic. It should be noted that a null circular orbit perpendicular to the symmetry axis can be
realized only on the equatorial plane, and its radius r±
phsatisfies r2−3Mr±2a√
Mr= 0 for the prograde (+) and
retrograde ( −) orbits, respectively. This implies that the critical radius mentioned above is nothing but r=r±
ph.
(Note that the value of r±
phfor the conformal Kerr background remains the same as that for the Kerr background
as a null geodesic remains unchanged under a conformal transformation.) For this reason, in what follows, we only
consider circular orbits for r > r±
ph.
Let us discuss the circular orbit in the case where the deviation of Ω from unity (i.e., the deviation from the Kerr
background) is small, without assuming a particular form of Ω( r, θ). In the case of Kerr background which has an
equatorial symmetry, one considers circular orbits within the equatorial plane θ=π/2.*7On the other hand, we expect
an off-equatorial orbit for our conformal Kerr background. Indeed, the absence of circular orbits on the equatorial
plane θ=π/2 on a parity-violating BH background has been pointed out in Refs. [75, 83]. However, the deviation
from θ=π/2 would be small when the deviation from the Kerr background is small. Assuming Ω = 1 + ϵϖ(r, θ) and
θ=π/2−ϵϑwith ϵbeing a small dimensionless parameter, the condition ∂rVeff= 0 yields

, (35)
where the positive and negative signs correspond to prograde and retrograde orbits, respectively. (Note that a <p
r3/Mforr > r +, and hence ω−<0.) Here and in what follows, the double signs are in the same order. Then,
from ∂θVeff= 0, we have
ϵϑ=ϵϑ±:=ϵr(r2−3Mr±2a√
Mr)
2M(r2+ 3a2∓4a√
Mr)∂θϖ(r, π/2) +O(ϵ2). (36)
*7We shall call θ=π/2 the equatorial plane, but note that the conformal Kerr spacetime is not symmetric under θ→π−θ.

--- page 8 ---

We note that ∂θϖ(r, π/2) sources the deviation of the circular orbit from the equatorial plane θ=π/2, which is
expected from the fact that the gradient of Ω serves as the effective external force [see Eq. (25)]. Note also that the
corrections of O(ϵ) in Eqs. (35) and (36) vanish in the limit of r→r±
ph, which is consistent with the fact that the null
circular orbit lies on the equatorial plane.
It is also important to study the stability of the orbit. As clarified in Appendix C, the information on the stability
under linear perturbations is also encoded in the second derivatives of the effective potential Veff. Written explicitly,
the stability conditions read
∂2
rVeff∂2
θVeff−(∂r∂θVeff)2>0 and1
grr∂2
rVeff+1
gθθ∂2
θVeff>0. (37)
Note that the left-hand sides of these conditions are regarded as functions of ronly, as we have already expressed ω
andθin terms of r. As explained earlier, a circular orbit can be realized only for r > r±
ph, and the orbit would be
unstable in the very vicinity of r=r±
ph. Also, for large enough rwhere the conformal factor approaches unity, the
spacetime is well described by the Kerr metric and the circular orbit would be stable. Therefore, we expect that the
stability should change at least once (precisely speaking, an odd number of times) within the range r±
ph< r < ∞. In
general, if the stability changes at some values of r(> r±
ph), these radii correspond to marginally stable circular orbits
(MSCOs). In the case of conformal Kerr BHs, as we shall see shortly, there can be multiple MSCOs, and the one with
the smallest value of ris the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). When the deviation from the Kerr background
is sufficiently small, there exists only a single MSCO, which is also the ISCO. The deviation from the ISCO radius
for the Kerr background, r(0)

For concreteness, let us now apply the above analysis to the conformal factor of the form (9), for which the deviation
from the Kerr background is controlled by the dimensionless parameter ˆ α:=α/(M4Λ4). In what follows, we assume
ˆα >0 for simplicity. When ˆ αis sufficiently small, one can substitute ˆ αforϵabove. Then, Eq. (36) implies that the
value of θcan be well approximated by θ≃π/2−ˆαϑ±
(1)with
ϑ±

We plot ϑ±
(1)as functions of rin Fig. 2. It should be noted that this approximation can be valid even for ˆ α=O(1) or
larger so long as ˆ αϑ±
(1)is negligible compared to π/2, which is the case when ris either large enough or close enough
tor±
ph. Then, the perturbative formulae for ω±andr±
ISCO [Eqs. (35) and (38), respectively] would also be valid. This
implies that ω±andr±
ISCO do not receive corrections at the first order in ˆ αsince the r-derivatives of ϖvanish at
θ=π/2 because of our particular choice of the conformal factor.
Figure 3 shows the comparison between ˆ αϑ±
(1)and the value of π/2−θobtained numerically. Obviously, the
approximation θ≃π/2−ˆαϑ±
(1)breaks down when |ˆαϑ±
(1)|becomes comparable to π/2. The figure shows that the
approximation works well up to ˆ α≈0.01 in the prograde case, while it works up to ˆ α≈10 in the retrograde case.
One can also study the stability of the circular orbit based on the conditions (37). For small values of ˆ α, there
exists only one MSCO, which is nothing but the ISCO. Interestingly, there exists a critical value of ˆ α(called ˆ αc)
above which three MSCOs appear, as shown in Fig. 4. The left panel shows the value(s) of rMSCO for the prograde
orbit around the conformal Kerr BH with a= 0.99Mfor different values of ˆ α, where the critical value is given by
ˆαc≈0.058. The ISCO for each ˆ αis indicated by an orange piecewise curve. This means that, for ˆ α > ˆαc, there is

blue dotted curve on which circular orbits can be realized. For reference, the particle motion for ˆ α= 0 (Kerr in GR) is also
shown by the green curve and it stays in the equatorial circular orbit.
C. Numerical experiments
Let us present several numerical experiments for the geodesic motion of a timelike test particle. Throughout this
subsection, we focus on the conformal factor of the form (9). Also, for demonstration purposes, we only consider the
case with a >0 and ˆ α >0.
Figure 5 shows the motion of a timelike test particle initially on the equatorial plane around the conformal Kerr BH
with a= 0.99Mand ˆα= 0.1. The initial condition is chosen so that the particle is in an equatorial prograde circular
orbit with r= 4.4Min the case of Kerr background with the same value of a. The left panel shows that the particle
orbit around the conformal Kerr BH (black) deviates from the equatorial plane, while the one around the Kerr BH
(green) remains on the equatorial plane. The right panel shows the particle orbit projected onto the plane corotating
with the particle, which is useful to keep track of the distance from the symmetry axis. If the particle is in a circular
motion, it stays at a point on the corotating plane. Hence, the Kerr case is represented by the green point located
at (rsinθ, rcosθ) = (4 .4M,0). In the conformal Kerr case, as mentioned earlier, the particle experiences the effective
external force Fµ∝∂µΩ and does not stay on the equatorial plane. However, as can be seen in the right panel,
the particle oscillates around some particular point on the corotating plane and is almost in a circular motion with
r≈4.4M. Actually, the center of the oscillation corresponds to the value of ( r, θ) that realizes the circular motion on
the conformal Kerr background. For reference, we plot ( rsinθ, rcosθ) for circular orbits with the blue dotted curve

a= 0.99Mand ˆα= 0.1. The top panel is the projection of the orbits onto the equatorial plane θ=π/2 and the bottom panel
is the projection onto the plane corotating with the particle. The green and black curves correspond to the particle orbits with
rini= (1±10−2)rISCO, respectively. The initial condition for ˙ φis chosen to be 10−9smaller than the value for an exactly

in the right panel. Note that (ˆ α, r) = (0 .1,4.4M) lies within the stable region in the left panel of Fig. 4, and hence it
is reasonable that the particle oscillates around this circular orbit.
In Fig. 6, we plot the motion of a test particle with the initial condition chosen so that the particle would be in
a retrograde (almost) circular motion perpendicular to the symmetry axis. Note that the initial condition for ˙ φis
slightly detuned from the value for an exactly circular motion. Specifically, we have chosen ˙ φini= (1−10−9) ˙φini,c,
where ˙ φini,cis the value for an exactly circular motion, so that the particle would plunge into the BH if the circular
orbit is unstable. The background spacetime is the same as in Fig. 5 (i.e., the conformal Kerr BH with a= 0.99M
and ˆα= 0.1). In this case, the retrograde orbits have only one MSCO, which is the ISCO with rISCO≈8.97M. We
consider the situation where the particles are initially put near the ISCO radius, rini= (1±10−2)rISCO. The top
panel clearly shows that the particle is in an almost circular orbit if rini> rISCO (green curve), while it plunges into
the BH if rini< rISCO (black curve). As the plunging particle approaches the BH horizon, the angular momentum of
the particle is aligned with the BH spin and the deviation from the equatorial plane becomes sizable.
Similar plots for prograde orbits are shown in Fig. 7. In this case, as mentioned earlier, there are three MSCO
radii rMSCO ≈1.22M, 1.50M, and 1 .93M, of which the innermost one corresponds to the ISCO. Hence, stable circular

exactly circular motion, so that the particle starts to plunge into the horizon (red circle) for an unstable circular orbit. In the

column are for rini= (1±10−2)×1.93M, while those in the right column are for rini= (1±10−2)×1.22M. In
either case, the particle is in an almost circular orbit if rini> rMSCO , while it is not if rini< rMSCO .*9Interestingly, if
the particle is initially put slightly inside r≈1.93M(i.e., the outermost MSCO radius), the particle oscillates within
1.2M≲r≲1.9Mand does not fall into the BH horizon as shown by black curves in the left column in Fig. 7.
Figure 8 shows the the motion of timelike test particles scattered by the conformal Kerr BH with a= 0.99Mand
ˆα= 1, where we expect that the motion of the particles would be significantly modified from the Kerr case. Each
particle starts on the equatorial plane with the same initial velocity but with different impact parameters. Similarly
to Fig. 5, the particles do not stay on the equatorial plane, and the scattering polar angle depends on the impact
parameter. As it should be, the smaller the impact parameter is, the larger the effects of parity violation are.
*9The opposite situation occurs for rMSCO ≈1.50M(i.e., the intermediate MSCO radius). Namely, the orbit is stable for rini< rMSCO
and unstable for rini> rMSCO .

IV. CONCLUSIONS
Recently, there have been growing interests in the possibility of parity violation in the history of the Universe as
well as in the vicinity of astrophysical objects. In Ref. [96], ghost-free pure metric theories of gravity with higher-
order derivatives have been obtained by performing an invertible conformal transformation on the Einstein-Hilbert
action, which we have reviewed in §II. When the conformal transformation depends on the Chern-Simons term P, the
resultant theory involves parity-violating interactions in general. Importantly, under this transformation, any vacuum
solution in GR is mapped to that in the transformed theory. We have chosen the Kerr solution in GR as a seed and
obtained a novel class of conformal Kerr metrics as an exact solution in the parity-violating gravitational theories.
We emphasize that our construction does not rely on either slow-rotation or near-extremal approximations.
In§III, we have investigated the geodesic motion of a test particle in the conformal Kerr spacetime. For a null
geodesic, as discussed in §III A, the geodesic equation remains the same as that in the Kerr spacetime. Therefore, one
cannot tell the difference between these two spacetimes from the motion of photon. On the other hand, for a timelike
geodesic, the geodesic equation receives a nontrivial correction, which can be understood as an effective external force.
The effective external force can have a nonvanishing θ-component, and hence, e.g., circular orbits perpendicular to the
symmetry axis do not lie in the equatorial plane. In §III B, we have derived a perturbative formula for the deviation
of such circular orbits from the equatorial plane. Interestingly, the deviation from the equatorial plane is different
for the prograde and retrograde circular orbits, which would offer a possibility to detect the equatorial asymmetry of
the conformal Kerr spacetime, e.g., through observations of orbiting stars. We have also studied the stability of the
circular orbits and found that the conformal Kerr BHs can have multiple MSCOs, which is a crucial difference from
the Kerr case. Finally, in §III C, we have presented several numerical experiments that highlight the difference from
the case of Kerr background in GR.
There are several possible future studies. While the null geodesic in the conformal Kerr spacetime is the same as that
in the Kerr spacetime, it does not necessarily mean that observed BH shadow remains unchanged since the accretion
of matter fields should be taken into account in reality. It would be intriguing to reveal how effects of the deviation
from the Kerr spacetime are imprinted in BH shadow. It would also be interesting to investigate perturbations of
the conformal Kerr solution in the parity-violating theory. In particular, the study of quasinormal modes as well as
the propagation of gravitational waves in the conformal Kerr spacetime would provide more insight into the possible
parity violation in our Universe. These issues are left for future work.

Appendix A: Chern-Simons scalar for the Kerr metric
In§II B, we studied a conformal transformation of the Kerr metric, where the conformal factor is a function of
the Chern-Simons term P[see Eq. (19)]. As discussed in §II A, the transformation is invertible so long as we are
interested in the region where Pis finite (i.e., unless we consider a curvature singularity). However, when such a
transformation is applied to the Kerr metric (or any other BH metrics), it would suffice if the invertibility condition is
satisfied (on and) outside the horizon: Namely, the invertibility condition may be violated inside the horizon. In this
case, in order to see whether the invertibility condition is satisfied, we have to know the possible range of Poutside

value of |P|.*10

Appendix C: Effective potential for circular orbits
In this appendix, we argue that circular orbits of a freely falling test particle on a general stationary axisymmetric
background spacetime as well as the stability of the orbits can be described by an effective potential.*11Let us
consider the most general stationary axisymmetric metric that is invariant under ( t, φ)→(−t,−φ),
gµνdxµdxν=gtt(r, θ)dt2+grr(r, θ)dr2+gθθ(r, θ)dθ2+gφφ(r, θ)dφ2+ 2gtφ(r, θ)dtdφ. (C1)
Note that there remains a gauge degree of freedom, and one could choose a gauge to reduce the metric (C1) to the
so-called Lanczos form [120]. However, we do not do so since Eq. (C1) is more useful for the application to the
conformal Kerr metric (see §III B).
The motion of a test particle is governed by the following geodesic equation:
¨xλ+ Γλ
µν˙xµ˙xν= 0, (C2)
*11A similar technique has been used in the literature, e.g., Refs. [115–119], but their analyses are restricted to a specific spacetime and/or
a null test particle. Our analysis here applies to the general stationary axisymmetric metric (C1), and the test particle can be either
timelike or null.

where a dot denotes the derivative with respect to an affine parameter sand Γλ
µνis the Christoffel symbol associated
with the metric gµν. Here, we define
−κ:=gαβ˙xα˙xβ=gtt˙t2+ 2gtφ˙t˙φ+gφφ˙φ2+grr˙r2+gθθ˙θ2. (C3)
Note that timelike and null geodesics have κ= 1 and 0, respectively. As was the case for the (conformal) Kerr metric,
there exist two conserved quantities
−E:=gtµ˙xµ=gtt˙t+gtφ˙φ,
Lz:=gφµ˙xµ=gtφ˙t+gφφ˙φ.(C4)
Let us now define an effective potential Veff(r, θ) by

zgtt+ 2ELzgtφ+E2gφφ

which satisfies
grr˙r2+gθθ˙θ2+Veff= 0. (C6)
In what follows, we show that a circular orbit, defined by r(s) = const = :r0andθ(s) = const = :θ0, can be discussed
in terms of the above Veff. First, Eq. (C6) immediately tells us that
Veff(r0, θ0) = 0 . (C7)
Second, imposing r(s) =r0andθ(s) =θ0in the r- and θ-components of the geodesic equation (C2) yields
∂rVeff(r0, θ0) = 0 , ∂ θVeff(r0, θ0) = 0 , (C8)
respectively. Finally, one can also show that the (in)stability of the circular orbit under linear perturbations is encoded
in the second derivatives of Veff. In order to investigate the stability, let us consider small fluctuations δr(s):=r(s)−r0
andδθ(s):=θ(s)−θ0about the circular orbit and study their evolution based on the geodesic equation (C2). At the
first order in the fluctuations, we have

(r,θ)=(r0,θ0). (C9)
Therefore, the circular orbit would be stable if both the eigenvalues of the matrix Ais positive, or equivalently, if
detA > 0 and tr A > 0. Note that the off-diagonal components of Avanish if the background spacetime has an
equatorial symmetry ( ∂θgµν= 0 at θ=π/2) and one considers an equatorial circular orbit with θ0=π/2. In this
case, the system of equations for δrandδθis decoupled and our analysis reduces to that in Ref. [121]. In particular,
one can show that an equatorial circular orbit in the Kerr spacetime is stable under linear perturbations in both r-
andθ-directions [121].
To summarize, a circular orbit with r(s) =r0andθ(s) =θ0satisfies
Veff(r0, θ0) = 0 , ∂ rVeff(r0, θ0) = 0 , ∂ θVeff(r0, θ0) = 0 , (C10)
and it would be stable under linear perturbations if
